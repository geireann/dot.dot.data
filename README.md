# Dot Dot Data `CS1951a Final Project`

## Data Cleaning
### Steps for cleaning the data and getting it set up:
1. Run `players.py` to webscrape the players dataset into the `grandmasters` SQL table
2. Run `games-geireann.py` to get the games dataset with FIDE_ID in the `games_id` SQL table
3. Run `merge.py` to combine the games database and the players database in the `merge` SQL table
4. Run `gm_age.py` to get the updated statistics for each database in the `games_new` SQL table
